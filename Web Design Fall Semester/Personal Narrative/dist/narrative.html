	<p>I wanted my personal website's primary focus to be engaging visuals.  That's why I knew I wanted the home page to be primarily image based.  At first I thought of doing a complete image background, or using image tabs, but finally I somehow settled on the idea of using polaroid pictures for the main navigation.  When I look at simpler things from a different time I find them to feel more authentic, at least for me.  At the risk of sounding trite, the word "vintage" might be a quasi-appropriate term for the overall tone I was trying to convey with my design. I wanted it to be clean,  simple, and engaging.</p>

	<p>I pulled all of the polaroid images off of creative commons for the sake of time, but overtime I would like to eventually replace them with my own.   The only text that appears on this page is my name, which always links back to the home page because I don't have tabs or a navigation bar.  I also photo-shopped (well, sumo-painted) words onto the photographs and included a footer that appears on numerous pages of the site with my contact information.  Typography has been a new area of study that I find particularly fascinating.  I tried out a few or more fonts on the header and other content of the site.  Triangles are my favorite shape, and I think the font I used for h1 is fun, modern, and really me.  The other fonts are subject to change, but for now they're alright.</p>

	<p>While developing the site, I used Google Chrome as my primary browser &mdash; and with that everything runs fairly smoothly. However, I think I would definitely need to troubleshoot a couple (okay, <em>more</em> than a couple) of things because I run into problems when it's opened on other browsers with the spacing, colors, other CSS, etc.  I've pretty much always used Google Chrome, but this project has only solidified it as my go to and dependable browser.  I don't even know why Internet Explorer still exists.</p>
	
	<p>I wanted the color palette to be mostly cool tones to contrast the warm tones that appear in the polaroid pictures.  I also used the magic that is Google and found a neat CSS trick with the help of a friend.  It fades the images into black and white when they're hovered over.  I thought that this added a nice subtle and complementary element to the overall feel of the homepage.  I also think it worked with the transparent header. </p> 
	
	<p>My "About" page was hard for me to write because I think it's really difficult to talk about myself.  I'm generally a pretty quirky individual and I was working with the words to try to find a balance between that characteristic and academia.  I edit things into the ground and like them one minute, and hate them the next.  So, on this page, and the others as well, I'll probably keep them changing with new thoughts, words, and ideas!  I included my contact information on here as well (nixed the footer), along with a picture, to give a face to the site for people who don't personally know me.  I ultimately want the site to be welcoming, user-friendly, and not intimidating or particularly boring.</p>

	<p>The other pages were meant to display my projects from current and past communications courses, as well as stuff that I thought would work to give character and provide information on a personal site.  I thought about what you said &mdash; about flooding the internet with good content of what you <em>want</em> people to see.  As I developed the site, I knew I wanted to share personal music and writing in addition to my multimedia projects.</p>
	
	<p>The "Project" page follows the same flow as the homepage with horizontal and gridded images.  To add some diversity, I added in some captions with brief descriptions of the projects.  The images link out (Thank you, target="_blank") to YouTube for the video and presentation projects, while the actual names of the project link to a blog post with more details of the project's process.  I think that in the future there might be a better way to work with this design (Orangebox?), but for the time being, I'm happy as long as it gets the job done.  I also think some significant tweaking could be done to make this page more responsive-friendly. </p>
	
	<p>I honestly think that's one of the most challenging things I faced with most of these pages.  Responsive web design is probably one of the most important things of a good design today, especially because of all the different digital devices and sizes of screens.  I think that I would definitely need to work on my design and the coding to reflect that more.  My coding could also <em>definitely</em> be tightened up as well &mdash; I did so much copying, pasting, erasing, ctrl-zing, that I think I may have enough divs to stretch to the moon and back, <em>twice</em>.</p>
	
	<p>My "Writing" page contains links to my two main blogs &mdash;one for my communications projects that looks more closely at things like digital aesthetics, and the other is a nature blog.  I'm writing this one to contribute to my Honors Senior Thesis research.  I'm a really earthy and nature girl, so I thought I would include this explorative blog to show a different side of me that isn't just academic.  Over the next few months as I edit, revise, and pick some of my favorite personal writing, I plan to add that to the writing page as well! I also included a "Photography" page, which I plan to update during the winter when I'm in my Digital Photography class.  I really want to put up more quality and thoughtful photos &mdash; so that page will be coming soon!  I was hesitant to leave so many holes on my website because I didn't want it to look like Swiss cheese; however, I want to really strive for good quality of the content rather than quantity.  I plan to keep reworking the writing and descriptions present on the site too.</p>
	
	<p>When I started drawing up the mockups for possible designs, I knew I wanted to include music on my site.  It's one of my true passions, and I love to write and perform songs.  A little while back, my sister and I decided to start a goofy YouTube channel.  Even though they're not necessarily professional in film quality or musically, I thought that they would add a nice charm to the site.  I eventually would really like to put up my own music on SoundCloud, or something of the like, and share that on the site as well.  Music is one of the biggest influences of my life, and it's also incorporated into the majority of my digital projects.  That's why I thought it would be neat to include it as a page.  I also played with the idea of putting in a radio/playlist, and album/vinyl reviews &mdash; but I would need more time to successfully and succinctly implement them onto the site.</p>
	
	<p>For my "Contact" page, I could never really decide how I wanted it to look, or how to include the information.  It was the last page I ended up working on, and it also took me the longest.  I found an image that I thought would work well with the theme of the site, thought up a friendly header, included an aside with my main contact information (again, nixed the footer here), and included a savvy CSS copy of my resume.  I love the fresh look of transparent boxes, so I decided to put my resume in one of those to make it stand out more and add a new element to the site.</p>
	
	<p>This was one of the most challenging long-term projects I have ever done.  I took this class because I always looked at Web Design as a sort of secret code.  I'd glance at it, feel intimidated, and think that it was something I'd never be smart enough to figure out.  However, I was excited by the challenge of learning something completely new and outside of my comfort zone.  I'm a really hands-on, adventurous, and visual person; I like all forms of art and just <em>making</em> things in general.  It was cool to transfer my love of art onto a more digital platform.  This was truly one of my most favorite courses I have ever taken here at St. Joe's.  Not only did it give me skills that I can carry into my future for a career or personal use, but it gave me the confidence to feel completely capable of jumping into something new and really learning, and more importantly enjoying the <em>experience</em> of learning.  I would rather program than be programmed, and besides, learning coding is also really adding a nice touch to my overall geekiness.</p>
	
	<p>Thank you for everything, Tim.  You made the course material fun, interesting, and memorable.  I also really enjoyed all of our music chats (Did you see that Brand New is playing shows on the East and West coast this December of <em>full</em> albums!?)  I'm sure I will see you around next semester, and I'll be sure to stop by if I have any dorky coding questions.  My website is something that I want to keep working on and improving.  Thank you for giving me the tools and knowledge to establish a foundation to do so.  I hope you have a relaxing winter break enjoying the snow and working on some rad poetry.</p>
