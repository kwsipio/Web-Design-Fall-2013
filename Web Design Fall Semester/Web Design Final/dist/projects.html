        <p>For this project, I designed a presentation that combined two areas of study that I'm interested in &mdash; music and typography. I experimented with a variety of presentation tools and techniques in order to turn the idea into an engaging visual and multimedia slide presentation. I studied the typography of classic and punk rock music from the 1970s to signify how music typography has had a lingering impact on later decades. Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Doors, The Who, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles are some of the bands featured in this presentation that have solidified their place in rock culture. Their fonts and band logos remain recognizable to this day. </p>

        <p>This video project documents how people are seeing through mediums and how the social web facilitates the growing trend toward more mediated (indirect) and sharable experiences. Smart phones and social media sites  provide a platform for users to visually document their everyday lived experience. Not only does this technology change how users record and share episodes of their lives with others,but this act of documentation may change how they experience life itself.  Is this trend of visually documenting everything we do becoming addicting and taking away from the <em>actual</em> experience of living? What are the social implications of it? This 3-5 minute video introduces the idea that we are living in a culture of lost digital strangers and is set to the song "We Used to Wait" by Arcade Fire.</p>

        <p>A cinemagraph is an image that contains within itself a living moment that allows a glimpse of time to be experienced and preserved endlessly.  It takes original content photography and adds an exciting and cinematic twist to it through the manipulation and isolation of animation in certain frames. These animated photographs really do capture a moment in time or a living portrait of a person or place &mdash; ultimately leading to an intriguing and innovative method of storytelling.  This project started out as a video and then moved to more photographic storytelling methods and editing through Adobe Photoshop.  The key to making a successful cinemagraph is to use something that has a subtle, yet consistent, movement.  For this project, I embraced my loved of music to create a record spinning cinemagraph. </p>

        <p>  Data visualization is the representation of information through images.  It is also a powerful and innovative tool for conveying information in a visually trendy way.  It's quickly embedding itself into digital communication and storytelling.  Illustrations and infographics provide us with an effective, engaging, and visual way to share information and make it accessible to audiences.  This project focused on creating a 3D and data-driven design, particularly concerning vinyl sales for <a href="http://www.recordstoreday.com/Home" target="_blank">Record Store Day</a>.  This day was founded in 2007 by vinyl enthusiasts who wanted to celebrate the culture and art of independently owned record stores and it is now internationally celebrated.  My infographic is a pie chart imposed onto an old record.  I use numbers and statistics to illuminate that RSD alone has been boosting vinyl sales each year.</p>

        <p>This 1-3 minute food documentary video demonstrates storytelling and editing capabilities through the sharing of a recipe.  My challenge was to employ digital technology in the most creative and effective way to tell a documentary story.  For this mini documentary, I chose to explore new filming techniques with food, specifically cupcakes.  The video is meant to display the simple aesthetics of springtime along with the flavors that are present in these delicious desserts, while maintaining an authentic and home-made quality.  This project was all about telling a digital story by the means of storyboarding, prop listing, location planning, scheduling, team collaboration, and more.  All images, video, and music provided in the video are original. </p>

        <p>This project revolved around the re-making of <a href="http://thisisdk.com/" target="_blank"> Digital Kitchen's </a> award winning main title sequence "Killer Breakfast" from Showtime's <a href="http://thisisdk.com/work/showtime/dexter-main-title" target="_blank"><em>Dexter</em></a>.  Film building skills were the priority of this project, as it took considerable storyboarding, precise video capturing and editing, close attention to aesthetics, POV, camera angles, lighting techniques, specific design shots to capture mood, creative problem solving, and extensive team collaboration.  My group and I filmed this during Winter 2013 and also presented it at Saint Joseph's University Celebration of Student Achievement in Spring 2013.  We discussed the process of the project with students and faculty, and offered tips and techniques for filming. </p>
